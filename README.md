6. Check the setting by clicking on the “Check the network” button. If the inscription is displayed in green showing the IP of a proxy and the location you selected while purchasing IP, then everything is working properly. But if the inscription is displayed in red, then you should re-check the setting or re-enter the data.

The proxy is configured properly in Lalicat Browser. We recommend using 1 profile per 1 IPv4/IPv6 proxy, to avoid blocking. Also, we recommend buying rotating mobile 4G/LTE proxies, as this format is the most secure and reliable, and they automatically rotate the IP address, so you can use more than 1 profile per 1 proxy. The setting of mobile proxies from Proxyseller is the same as mentioned IPv4 setting above.
